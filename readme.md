## Basic Organization
This repository is organized according to major evaluation areas as of June 2017. It is intended to be flexible so that directories can be added/removed according to project changes. Further readme files may be added to elaborate within sub-directories. Code should be organized by evaluation area, not country.

1. resource_tracking

   Data processing and analysis of financial inputs
   
2. process_evaluation

   Data processing and analysis of results from process evaluation. May not be relevant because most process evaluation outputs will be qualitative.
   
3. outcome_measurement

   Data processing and analysis health outcomes (coverage, prevalence, mortality etc).
   
4. impact_evaluation

   Data processing and analysis relating inputs to outcomes and outcome to impact. Not intended to be used for the actual estimation of inputs and outcomes; mostly for the modeling that uses it.
   
5. vfm 

   Data processing and analysis of Value for Money
   
6. special_assessments 

   Data processing and analysis for idiosyncratic and country-specific analyses/evaluations/assessments that may arise.
   
7. primary_data

   Data processing and analysis for any data that we collect as part of the PCE.
   
8. core

   Generalized functions and prep code for data that could be used in any analysis.

9. miscellaneous 

   Code for anything that doesn\'t fit in the above folders. Intended to be mostly small, side analyses.
